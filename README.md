=========================================

This is not 100% tested however most pages have been completed. The column-right modules have not been tested. Please let me know what you find that can be fixed or improved. This is my first attempt at a responsive opencart theme. Please use it as a starter theme to construct your own projects. If you use it, please send me a shot out at

1. Create a directory in catalog > view > theme titled whatever you wish
2. Upload these files to that directory you created.
3. Change the catalog > view > theme > 'Theme title' > template > common > header.tpl file to match whatever you wish to name the theme.
