Opencart version: 1.5.5.1

=========================================

This is not 100% tested however most pages have been completed. The column-right modules have not been tested. Please let me know what you find that can be fixed or improved. This is my first attempt at a responsive opencart theme. Please use it as a starter theme to construct your own projects. If you use it, please send me a shot out at 

Installation:
1. Take the theme file and upload it to catalog > view > theme
2. Change the catalog > view > theme > 'Theme title' > template > common > header.tpl file to match whatever you wish to name the theme. 

Thanks!
